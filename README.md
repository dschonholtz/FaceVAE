# A Simple FaceVAE example

This code is largely from the following guide. I have added some comments to make sure I understand what is going on and have mucked with the input a bit.
I also typed most of it rather than copying/pasting to make sure I knew what was going where.

## Where is the data?
The input folder is intentionally missing
to prevent having to pull and push
the dataset. It's only 112 MB and LFS could handle it
But I opted to not bother.
It can be found here:
