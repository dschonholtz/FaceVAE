# A Simple FaceVAE example

This code is from this tutorial.
The code is not my own.

What is my own is the incessant comments. I decided if I was lifting someone elses
code I could at least make sure to understand it by putting a comment on every line explaining
what was happening.

## Where is the data?
The input folder is intentionally missing
to prevent having to pull and push
the dataset. It's only 112 MB and LFS could handle it
But I opted to not bother.
It can be found here:
